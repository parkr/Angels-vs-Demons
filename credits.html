			<li><span class="name">Vero S.</span><br><span class="description">Vero's room serves as your first step into the battle realm, where you will have to make one crucial decision... Are you an angel? Or are you a devil? Choose your path and open the door to the proceeding rooms, where you will be able to choose weapons to support your side of the battle! <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~vserva1/room1.html">Begin.</a></span></li>
			<li><span class="name">Jath M.</span><br><span class="description">Jath's room is the <strong>final battleground</strong> between the good and evil. There, the user must solve a puzzle to either release their fellow angels or deal a blow to the angels, depending upon which side they chose at the outset. Are you ready? <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~jmahen/">Begin.</a></span></li>
			<li><span class="name">Patrick C.</span><br><span class="description">Patrick's room allows Angels to weaken their opponent as they make their way to the battlefield through enemy lines. Demon's may reinforce their clan in order to increase their strength as they prepare for battle. <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~pcrane/teamPage/">Begin.</a></span></li>
			<li><span class="name">Parker M.</span><br><span class="description">Parker's room allows the angels to pick up various items that they may need for a battle when they encounter a demon. They may rest and rehabilitate while here as well as chat with other angels about their experiences fighting the demons. <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~pmoore6/a4/">Begin.</a></span></li>
